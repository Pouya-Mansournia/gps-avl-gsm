Key Features:

GPS Tracking: The project harnessed the power of GPS technology to accurately determine the vehicle's location at any given time. This data was then sent to the central server using GSM communication.

GSM Communication: Utilizing SIM908 and SIM800 GSM modules, the system established a reliable communication channel with the central server. This enabled real-time data transmission and remote control capabilities.

Live Road Tracking: One of the standout features of the project was its ability to provide live road tracking. The data gathered from the GPS module was continuously updated on a web interface, allowing users to monitor the vehicle's movement in real time.

Remote Relay Control: The integration of the ATmega64 microcontroller enabled remote relay control. This feature could be utilized to remotely trigger actions such as engine immobilization, door locking/unlocking, and more.
